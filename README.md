# Simple aquaristic controller
## This project is a simple prototype of Aquaristic controller.

## What I expected from this project:
- Automatic water change
- Automatic water addition
- Feeding mode
- Simple controlling devices like *heater*, *UVC sterilization lamp*, *aeration pump* and many more.

## Hardware
This project works on Arduino Due board. What will you need is:
- LCD 2004 with I2C converter like PCF8574
- simple analog joystick like KY-023
- SSR relay boards, it depends how you want to connect it all together
- power supply

It needs to work an LCD 2004 with I2C converter like PCF8574,
a simple analog joystick and power supply.
SSR relay board (normal mechanical relays are creating electromagnetic interferences that breaks an Arduino)
